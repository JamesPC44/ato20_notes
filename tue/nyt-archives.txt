## Why digitize the NYT Archives?

- hard and time-consuming to navigate
- articles are irreplacable: a week long flood can destroy decades of information
- technology made it feasible

## How do you do it?

- Need to know copyright
- scanning images
  + scans do not come with rotation metadata
  + horizon detection didn't work very well
  + tried facial recognition instead
- images come with captions - you can run image recognition on that!
  + doesn't work well with handwriting, though
- very difficult to clean data: long tail of missing/messy data
  + lots of opencv and imagemagick
  + tools had trouble distinguishing between L and 1
- used postgres until they couldn't, then used elasticsearch
