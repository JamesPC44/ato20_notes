## Open Source as a Business

 - Project developed
 - Venture funded
 - Company created

## Building successful business

 - Attractive messaging
 - Build monopoly, avoid commoditization
 - Increase stickiness
 - Build anti-competitive "moats"

## Note quite Open Source

 - Open core
 - Open Source eventually
 - ... missed other two models due to rapid slide transition.

Good: Allows more investment and higher innovation pace.
Bad: Does not provide max value from Open Source.

## Rise of the cloud

## Hijacking the GPL

 - Used to be a good way to protect your software from being used in commercial software, but not anymore!
 - Amazon Aurora and Amazon's Redis clone, etc.

## Great Rebundling

 - Bundling of hardware usage costs and software.
 - No more "zero price effect"
   - "Humans are attracted to free stuff!"

## Great momentum for commercial Open Source

 - Heavily developing movement of the 2020 era.
 - Red Hat, MongoDB, Github, Databricks, Elastic, Hashicorp, Confluent, Cloudera, etc. all worth billions *each*.

## COVID-19 Pandemic

 - Accelerates adoption of Open Source products due to needs to cut costs, and digital transformations happening.

## No one wants to be a hostage

 - Even if not painful short-term, long term, transitioning away can be very painful.

## What are your goals in being involved with Open Source?

 - "Just for fun"
 - Make it a career
 - Make a difference
 - Build a business

### Is there an existing project?

### Project vs Product

 - Any code on Github can be called "Open Source"
 - Many project are focused on their developer(s)
 - Developers write the code they feel like writing
 - May not care about documentation, compatibility, QA
 - May not care about user and customer support
 - Many successful projects may be "selfish", working just on what the main developers care about

## Product commitment to users and customers

 - Clear licensing
 - Lifecycle, defined compatibility, upgrade path
 - Builds/packages
 - Documentation
 - Free or Commercial support, Bug/issues handling
 - Security issues and remediation
 - Quality assurance

> Are sub-package licenses included in "Clear licensing"?

A: Yes! This is important with larger companies wanting to use your code. Some licenses, like the BSD licenses, are compatible with other relicensing, 

## Business Model not Required

 - You may choose not to focus on building a company around your Open Source project.
 - If you don't build such a company, others may!
 - Ex: Linux. No business model, but it turned out okay for the creators.

## Open Source Business Models

 - Model first, license second
   - Your business model will drive appropriate license choices
 - "Open Source is not a business model." -- Marten Mickos

## Business and Open Source

 - Open Source is not a specific business model.
 - You can build a business model and distribution model *around* Open Source though.
 - "MongoDB was built by MongoDB. There was not prior art. We didn't Open Source it for help; we Open Sourced it as a freemium strategy." -- MongoDB CEO quote from an interview.

## Open Source distribution model

 - Channels available that are unique from commercial routes
   - Ex: Github
 - Inclusion in major operating system distributions
 - Becoming parts of other project(s)

## Open Source development model

 - Code contributions
 - Testing/bugs
 - Ideas
 - Documentation

## Open Source community

 - Open Source communities uniquely strong and loyal (on average, compared to proprietary software).

## Open Source for marketing

 - "Open Source" is a positive
 - Project users are more likely to promote it for reciprocity
 - Easier to market your product for free

## Business models: the outcome

 - Build a business with a "big exit" (for lots of money)
 - Make a good living for myself and a few friends

## Big Exit

 - Product-focused business
 - Creating IP
 - Building anti-competitive moats
 - Obsessing with scaling
 - Raising capital often required
 - "Open Source" takes a backseat

## Lifestyle business

 - Can be a service business (products possible too)
   - Consultant work very common
 - Proceed at your own pace
 - Easier to focus on "Open Source"
 - Easier to bootstrap
   - Often done part-time, with minimal capital

## Distribution vs Monetization

 - Distribution focus
   - Focus on growing number of users of the Open Source Software
 - Monetization focus
   - Focus on converting users to paying customers, and increasing spend per paying customer
 - Major conflict between these two ideas!
   - Ex: Amazon RDS takes business away from Oracle, who does a lot of MySQL development.

## Open Source Business models overview

 - Services (Consulting and engineering)
 - Support and management services
 - Dual licensing
 - Advanced commercially licensed version
 - SaaS (Software as a Service)
 - Ad Supported

### Consulting and custom engineering

 - Easy to get into
 - Relatively low margin
   - Customers won't pay a massive premium for your services over the going rates.
 - Non-recurring
 - Hard to scale
   - Consulting work doesn't scale very well, requires heavy hiring, which is tough.

### Support and managed services

 - Recurring
 - Generally better margins
 - Easier to scale
   - Scaling across customers is less relative to number of customers
 - Medium investment to start

### Dual licensing

 - Product-based
 - Sell commercially licensed version of the product for those who can't comply with the terms of the main open-source license

### Advanced commercially licensed version

 - Product-based
 - Enhanced version of the product is sold
 - Typically packaged with additional benefits as a subscription

### SaaS

 - SaaS version of software is commercially available
 - Can be paired with the "freemium model"
 - In most cases, SaaS version is not 100% Open Source
   - Ex: Proprietary plugins, backplane, or setup process.

### Ad supported

 - Open Source version includes ads
   - May also include functionality to remove ads for a fee
 - Ex: Firefox partnering with Google to avoid ads, by channeling search traffic to Google.

## Go to market

 - Selling to end users
   - Large volume
   - Small/medium average deal size
   - Inexpensive/quick sales process
 - Selling to enterprise
   - Low volume
   - Large deal size
   - Expensive/long sales process

## Ownership and Governance

 - Community/foundation-governed product
   - Ex: Linux, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Drupal
 - Single company-governed product
   - Ex: MySQL, MongoDB, Nginx

## Licenses for Open Source Software

 - Disclaimer: Author is not a lawyer, do not take their opinions as legal advice!

## Two types of Open Source

 - Open Source in substance
 - Open Source for marketing

## Truly Open Source

 - OSI initiative
 - GNU "free software" community
 - Debian social contract

## Free software -- Four Essential Freedoms

From the GNU folks, see the site for the list.

## Open Source Business

 - Monetizing truly open source software is hard

## Openness Choice

 - Permissive open source license
   - Maximize distribution
 - Copyleft open source license
 - Source available license
 - Proprietary software
   - Maximize monetization

## Types of open source

 - Permissive
   - Can modify software (create derived works), and do whatever you want with it, including licensing it commercially.
 - Copyleft
   - If you modify the software, you need to distribute the changes under the same license.

## What is typical in the ecosystem

 - Linux :: GPL
 - Kubernetes :: Apache 2.0
 - PostegreSQL :: PostegreSQL license

## License/model fit

### Consulting and custom engineering

 - Permissive licenses work great
 - More adoption -- more business
 - Public cloud SaaS is not major competition

### Support and managed services

 - Can work well with variety of license types
 - More concern around competition from cloud vendors who can scale massively

### Dual licensing

 - Relies on open source license limitations
 - Typically copy-left (and source available) licenses

### Advanced commercial version

 - Different strategies can be employed
 - The more "full featured" your "Open Source" version, the more the need for copyleft or source available licenses
 - If "Open Source" is severely limited, it can be permissively licensed

### SaaS

 - To prevent competition from hyper-scaling cloud vendors, source available licenses are often used

### Ad supported

 - Can work with any license

## Trends of permissive vs copyleft

 - In 2012, Copyleft licensing was more common
 - In 2019, Permissive licensing was the majority

## Current trend: Rise of source available licenses

 - Examples: MongoDB, Redis Labs, Confluent, Elastic

## "Combination"

 - How do you expect your software to be combined with other Open Source and proprietary software by your users?

## Marketplaces

 - Many marketplaces do not allow the AGPL license
 - Apple Appstore does not allow the GPL

## License and Copyright

 - As the copyright holder, you can change the license at any time (for new versions of the software)
 - If you want to have those rights ensure you should have a contributors agreement which grants you the rights you want
   - Prevents developers from halting license changes later

## Open Source and Trademark

 - Licenses differ in how they handle trademarks.
 - Many companies handle trademarks separately from source licenses.

## Open Source and Patents

 - Licenses differ in how they handle patent rights, if they handle the issue at all.
 - Newer licenses tend to be more specific in patent grants.

## Need more protection?

 - Funky "Polyform" license

## Summary

 - Decide on what your goals are
 - Pick business model to reach those goals
 - Pick open sources licenses to support those goals
 - Contribute to open source as much as your can!
